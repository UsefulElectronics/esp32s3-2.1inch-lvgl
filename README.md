# ESP32 Round Display Lamp Control Over MQTT
***
### [Tutorial Link](https://youtu.be/PwD3RC23oUE) On [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-FF0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/wardzx1) 

In this video, the ESP32S3 microcontroller is programmed to interface with a 2.1-inch round display (480x480 px) from Viewedisplay using ESP-IDF. The ESP32S3 connects to a Wi-Fi network and publishes data over MQTT to control an addressable LED lamp remotely.

The display shows the Wi-Fi and MQTT broker connection status, as well as the lamp's on/off state, brightness, and color settings. A rotary encoder and button integrated with the display allow for remote control of the lamp's functions.

We also measure the round display's current consumption using a Miniware variable power supply.

The video provides a detailed explanation of the firmware running on the ESP32S3, including the hardware configuration, FreeRTOS tasks, and callbacks.
